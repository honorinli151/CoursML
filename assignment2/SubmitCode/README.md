# Submission Code for MA2823

To run the code which generate the submission model please run `submitTrain.py`. To load the submission model that we have submitted to Kaggle please run `submitModel.py`. 

Besides, in order to make this code sustainable, we choose *Python 3* as our python interpreter, because many libraries are going to stop supporting python 2 in the near future (for example Pandas will stop supporting python 2 from January 1, 2019.)

To install the libraries needed, please use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements.txt given.
